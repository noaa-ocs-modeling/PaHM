<p ><em>PAHM</em> contains various light-weight parametric tropical cyclone (TC) models that require minimal computational resources to produce the wind fields on the fly and fast. Such models use limited physics in producing "accurate" wind fields in the vicinity of the storm's path. The wind fields are generated at the gradient level (Figure</p>
<p ><em>PAHM</em> generates its wind fields at the gradient level. The gradient level is roughly 1 km above the surface of the earth, and is the level most representative of the air flow in the lower atmosphere immediately above the layer affected by surface friction. This level is free of local wind and topographic effects (such as sea breezes, downslope winds etc). The 10-m wind may be estimated by decreasing the gradient level wind speed by approximately 20% over the ocean, 40% over land.</p>
<p >Timely and accurate estimate of the surface pressure and wind fields of a tropical cyclone (TC) is critical to storm surge forecasting and coastal risk assessment. Currently, prediction of a TC‚Äôs wind field can be achieved through multiple approaches. One approach is through the use of atmospheric models, which are either statistical, dynamical, or combined statisticaldynamical, to obtain wind forecasts or nowcasts. The statistical ones empirically predict the evolution of a TC by extrapolating from historical datasets, while the dynamical models solve the full set of primitive equations of fluid flow in the atmosphere to obtain numerical results, which are quite computationally intensive. In recent years, the kinematic analysis approach showed promise to offer more realistic and accurate wind estimates, either in real-time or in hindcast mode. One example is the Surface Wind Analysis System (H*Wind) operated by the Hurricane Research Division (HRD) before 2014, which produces H*Wind snapshots of TCs from 1993 ‚Äì 2013 by assimilating all available surface wind observations (e.g., from ships, buoys, coastal platforms, reconnaissance aircrafts, and satellites, etc.) into a common framework for height (10m), exposure, and averaging period (Powell et al., 1996). Given its versatile inputs, the H*Wind products are considered to be among the most sophisticated and reliable surface wind reconstructions.</p>
<p >A third approach, which is the parametric approach, is favored for its simplicity and lower coast that are vital for timely operational forecasting. In this approach, the surface wind 2 field of a TC can be estimated as the sum of the storm vortex winds and the background winds of the environment. The vortex winds are usually depicted by a radial wind profile, whose formula is either derived from the gradient or cyclostrophic wind balance equation, or simply an empirical expression acquired from historical storm events. The background winds are of a much larger scale, and among other factors, are responsible for steering the movement of a TC (Shapiro, 1983) and considered to account for some of the asymmetry observed in the overall wind field. Currently, there is no clear consensus on how to determine the distribution of background winds due to insufficient observational data. In many applications, it was common to set the background winds equal to the storm‚Äôs translational velocity ùëâùëá ‚Éó‚Éó‚Éó‚Éó (e.g., Powell et al., 2005; Mattocks and Forbes, 2008), while in many others, the background winds were assumed to be in the same direction as ùëâùëá ‚Éó‚Éó‚Éó‚Éó but with reduced magnitudes by various factors (e.g., radially varies between 0-0.5 by Jelesnianski et al., 1992, Phadke et al., 2003, and Hu et al., 2012; azimuthally varies between 0-0.5 by Georgiou, 1985, and Xie et al., 2006; constant 0.6 by Emanuel et al., 2006; constant 0.5 by Lin et al., 2012a). Lin and Chavas (2012b) introduced a methodology via vector decomposition of H*Wind surface wind fields to investigate the relationship between the surface background winds and ùëâùëá ‚Éó‚Éó‚Éó‚Éó , and found that statistically the surface background winds are reduced by a factor of ùõº = 0.55 and rotated counter-clockwise (in the Northern Hemisphere) by an angle of ùõΩ = 20¬∞ relative to ùëâùëá ‚Éó‚Éó‚Éó‚Éó . The classic Holland Model (HM, 1980) is one of most commonly used analytical vortex models, which is also one of the meteorological forcing options in the ADCIRC storm surge model (NWS = 19). A thorough look at its formulation reveals that the HM suffers a few flaws due to the assumptions made during its derivation. Development of a more generalized Holland Model is presented in Chapter 2.</p>
<p >Given storm characteristics (i.e., track, intensity, and size), the axisymmetric component of the surface wind may be estimated by calculating the wind velocity at gradient level with a hurricane wind profile and translating the gradient wind to the surface level with an empirical surface wind reduction factor (SWRF) [Powell et al., 2003] and inflow angle [e.g., Bretschneider, 1972] to account for the effect of surface friction on the storm. (A boundary layer model [e.g., Thompson and Cardone, 1996; Vickery et al., 2009b; Kepert, 2010] may be applied to more accurately calculate the surface wind from the gradient condition, but it is nonparametric and more computationally expensive.) A number of gradient wind profiles [e.g., Holland, 1980; Jelesnianski et al., 1992; Emanuel, 2004] have been widely used in wind and surge analysis, but the wind and surge calculated using these profiles have yet to be compared in a statistical sense (though case studies do exist [e.g., Phadke et al., 2003]). Although it may be difficult at this point to identify the ‚Äúbest‚Äù wind profile, as each profile has its own strengths and limitations, the knowledge of how wind and surge estimates vary with different profiles is necessary in uncertainty analysis. It is also useful to investigate the sensitivities of wind and surge estimates to the effect of surface friction on the storm, for example, by examining the sensitivities to SWRF and inflow angle, the values of which have not been agreed upon [Vickery et al., 2009a] and may vary with storm conditions and wind speeds [Powell et al., 2005]</p>

Holland 1980</h1>
<p >The traditional Holland Model (<a class="el" href="biblio.html#holland1">Holland 1980</a>), thereafter HM80, is one of most widely used tropical cyclone (TC) analytical vortex models to generate meteorological forcings near the path of the storm. HM80 solves the reduced physics gradient wind equation \(\ref{eqn_holl80_grad_wind}\). Gradient winds are those theoretical winds that blow parallel to curved isobar lines or height-contour lines in the absence of turbulent drag (gradient level winds). The gradient level is roughly 1 km above the surface of the earth, and is the level most representative of the air flow in the lower atmosphere immediately above the layer affected by surface friction. This level is free of local wind and topographic effects (such as sea breezes, downslope winds etc) and it is commonly defined atop the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL).</p>
<p >For the gradient winds there is no balance between the Coriolis force and the Pressure gradient force (as this is the case for geostrophic winds), resulting in a non-zero net force \(F_{net}\) known as the Centripetal force. This \(F_{net}\) is what causes the wind to continually change direction as it goes around a circle as shown in figures <a class="el" href="models.html#fig1">1</a> and <a class="el" href="models.html#fig2">2</a> (<a class="el" href="biblio.html#stull1">Stull 2017</a>). By describing this change in direction as causing an apparent force (Centrifugal), we can find the equation for the gradient wind. Equation \(\ref{eqn_holl80_grad_wind}\) defines the steady-state gradient wind and represents the balance of the Pressure Gradient Force \((F_{PG})\), Centrifugal \((F_{CN} = - F_{net})\) and Coriolis \((F_{CF})\) forces at the gradient level (figures <a class="el" href="models.html#fig1">1</a> and <a class="el" href="models.html#fig2">2</a>):</p>

  \underbrace{\frac{r}{\rho_{air}}\frac{\partial P(r)}{\partial r}}_{F_{PG} \, \text{term}} = 0
  \label{eqn_holl80_grad_wind}
\end{equation}
</p>
<p >where: \(V_{g}(r)\) is the gradient level wind speed at radius \(r\), \(P(r)\) is the pressure at radius \(r\), \(r\) is the radial distance, \(f = 2 \Omega \sin\phi\) is the Coriolis parameter, \(\Omega = 7.27221\cdot 10^{-5} s^{-1}\) is the rotational speed of the earth, \(\phi\) is the latitude in radians and \(\rho_{air}\) is the air density (assumed constant: \(1.15 \, kg / m^3\)).

<p >To derive the analytical expression for \(V_{g}(r)\), HM80 assumed a surface pressure profile that is approximated by the following hyperbolic equation:</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation}
  P(r) = P_{c} + (P_{n} - P_{c}) e^{-A/r^B}
  \label{eqn_holl80_hyp_pres_prof}
\end{equation}
</p>
<p >where: \(A, \, B\) are scaling parameters, \(P(r)\) is the pressure at radius \(r\), \(P_{n}\) is the ambient pressure (assumed constant: \(1013.25 \, mbar\)) and \(P_{c}\) is the central pressure. Substituting the expression for \(P(r)\) into equation \(\ref{eqn_holl80_grad_wind_rootsa}\) and, the following expression for the wind speed at the gradient level is obtained:</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation}
  V_{g}(r) = \sqrt{ A B (P_{n} - P_{c}) e^{-A/r^B} / \rho_{air} r^{B} + \big(\frac{r f}{2}\big)^2} - \frac{r f}{2}
  \label{eqn_holl80_vg}
\end{equation}
</p>
<p >To determine the scaling parameters \(A\) and \(B\), it is assumed that at the region of the radius of maximum winds (RMW) that is, at the region of the sustained maximum wind speeds \((r = R_{max} = \text{RMW})\), the wind speed \(V_{g}\) satisfies the first of equations \(\ref{eqn_holl80_asump}\). It is also assumed that the Rossby number \(R_{o}\) is very large (the third of equations \(\ref{eqn_holl80_asump}\)), so that the Coriolis forces can be neglected and therefore the air is in cyclostrophic balance (<a class="el" href="biblio.html#holland1">Holland 1980</a>) as described by equation \(\ref{eqn_holl80_vg_cycl}\) for the cyclostrophic wind speed \(V_{c}(r)\).</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation}
  V_{g} = V_{max} \,;\quad \frac{dV_{g}}{dr} = 0 \,;\quad R_{o} = \frac{V_{max}}{f R_{max}} \gg 1
  \label{eqn_holl80_asump}
\end{equation}
</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation}
  V_{c}(r) = V_{g}(r)\Big|_{r \rightarrow R_{max}} = \sqrt{ A B (P_{n} - P_{c}) e^{-A/r^B} / \rho_{air} r^{B}}
  \label{eqn_holl80_vg_cycl}
\end{equation}
</p>
<p >Applying the second of the conditions in equations \(\ref{eqn_holl80_asump}\) on equation \(\ref{eqn_holl80_vg_cycl}\), we find that the radius of maximum winds is independent of the relative values of the ambient and the central pressure and it is defined only by the scaling parameters \(A\) and \(B\) as: \(R_{max} = A^{1/B}\), or \(A = R_{max}^{B}\). Substituting the expression for \(A\) into equation \(\ref{eqn_holl80_vg_cycl}\) and setting \(V_{c}(R_{max}) = V_{max}\), the expression for the scaling parameter \(B\) (widely known as the Holland \(B\) parameter) is readily determined:</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation}
  A = R_{max}^{B} \,;\quad
  B = \frac{\rho_{air} e V_{max}^{2}}{P_{n} - P_{c}}
  \label{eqn_holl80_scale}
\end{equation}
</p>
<p >Physically, the Holland parameter \(B\) defines the shape of the pressure profile (equation \(\ref{eqn_holl80_hyp_pres_prof}\)) while, the parameter \(A\) determines its location relative to the origin (<a class="el" href="biblio.html#holland1">Holland 1980</a>). HM80 states that plausible ranges of B would be between 1 and 2.5 to to limit the shape and size of the vortex. Based on equations \(\ref{eqn_holl80_hyp_pres_prof}\), \(\ref{eqn_holl80_vg}\) and \(\ref{eqn_holl80_scale}\), and re-organizing the pressure and the gradient wind speed equations, the final equations of the HM80 parametric TC model that <em>PAHM</em> solves are summarized as follows:</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align}
  &amp; B = \frac{\rho_{air} e V_{max}^{2}}{P_{n} - P_{c}}
  \label{eqn_holl80_b} \\[10pt]
  &amp; P(r) = P_{c} + (P_{n} - P_{c}) \cdot e^{-(R_{max} / r)^{B}}
  \label{eqn_holl80_pres} \\[10pt]
  &amp; V_{g}(r) = \sqrt{ V_{max}^{2} \cdot \big(\frac{R_{max}}{r}\big)^{B} \cdot e^{1 - (R_{max} / r)^{B}}
               + \big(\frac{r f}{2}\big)^2} - \frac{r f}{2}
  \label{eqn_holl80_vg1}
\end{align}
</p>
<p >As reasoned in (<a class="el" href="biblio.html#gao2">Gao 2018</a>), a large \(R_{o}\) \((\,\orderof{10^3}\,)\) describes a system in cyclostrophic balance dominated by inertial and centrifugal forces with negligible Coriolis force (e.g., a tornado or the inner core of an intense hurricane), while a small value \(R_{o}\) \((10^{-2} \sim 10^{2})\) describes a system in geostrophic balance strongly influenced by the Coriolis force (e.g., the outer region of a TC). Therefore, the cyclostrophic balance assumption made in HM80 is only valid for describing an intense but narrow TC with a large \(R_{o}\), and not suitable for weak but broad tropical cyclones with small \(R_{o}\) values. Although this is a limitation of the HM80 model, equations \(\ref{eqn_holl80_b}\) through \(\ref{eqn_holl80_vg1}\), are widely used in hurricane risk studies and storm surge studies due to their simplicitly and their capability to generate the atmospheric fields quickly and efficiently.</p>

Generalized Asymmetric Vortex Holland model (<em>GAHM</em>)</h1>
<p >The Generalized Asymmetric Vortex Holland model (<a class="el" href="biblio.html#gao2">Gao 2018</a> and <a class="el" href="biblio.html#gao1">Gao 2015</a>) extends HM80 by eliminating the cyclostrophic assumption at the the region of RMW (the third of equations \(\ref{eqn_holl80_asump}\)) to allow the generation of representative wind fields for a wider range of TCs. <em>GAHM</em> also introduces a composite wind methodology to fully use all multiple storm isotachs in TC forecast or best track data files to account for asymmetric tropical cyclones such as a land-falling hurricane.</p>
<p ><em>GAHM</em> model solves the gradient wind equation for \(V_{g}\) (equation \(\ref{eqn_holl80_grad_wind_rootsa}\)) by eliminating the influence of the Rossby number \((R_{o})\)) on the gradient wind solution assuming that:</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation}
  V_{g} = V_{max} \,;\qquad \frac{dV_{g}}{dr} = 0
  \label{eqn_gahm_asump}
\end{equation}
</p>
<p >The pressure profile used is the same as in HM80 (equation \(\ref{eqn_holl80_hyp_pres_prof}\)) where the scaling parameter \(A\) is slightly re-defined by introducing a new scaling factor \((\phi)\) : \(\phi = A / R_{max}^{B}\), or \(A = \phi R_{max}^{B}\). Substituting the expression for \(A\) into equation \(\ref{eqn_holl80_vg}\) and using the second of equations \(\ref{eqn_gahm_asump}\), an adjusted Holland B parameter \((B_{g})\), is derived as:</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation}
  B_{g} = \frac{(V_{max}^{2} + f V_{max} R_{max}) \rho_{air} e^{\phi}}{\phi(P_{n} - P_{c})} =
          B \frac{(1 + 1 / R_{o}) e^{\phi - 1}}{\phi} \,;\qquad
  B = \frac{\rho_{air} e V_{max}^{2}}{P_{n} - P_{c}}
  \label{eqn_gahm_bg}
\end{equation}
</p>
<p >Substituting the expressions for \(A\) and \(B \, (\text{replaced by} \, B_{g})\) into equation \(\ref{eqn_holl80_vg}\) and using the first of equations \(\ref{eqn_gahm_asump}\), the final expression for the scaling parameter \(\phi\) is derived:</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{equation}
  \phi = \frac{1 + f V_{max} R_{max}}{B_{g}(V_{max}^{2} + f V_{max} R_{max})}
       = 1 + \frac{1 / R_{o}}{B_{g} (1 + 1/R_{o})}
  \label{eqn_gahm_phi}
\end{equation}
</p>
<p >Based on equations \(\ref{eqn_holl80_hyp_pres_prof}\), \(\ref{eqn_holl80_vg}\), \(\ref{eqn_gahm_bg}\), and \(\ref{eqn_gahm_phi}\) and re-organizing the pressure and the gradient wind speed equations, the final equations of the <em>GAHM</em> parametric TC model that <em>PAHM</em> solves are summarized as follows:</p>
<p class="formulaDsp">
\begin{align}
